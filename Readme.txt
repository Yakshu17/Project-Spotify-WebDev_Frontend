These files are consists of "Html"(Hyper Text Markup Language) And "Css"(Cascading Style Sheet) code ,which is used to make structure and decoration for web page.

I am starting with explaning tags:-------->

In head tag, I've used two "link rel" tags to connect the "Style.css" file with html and other file is icon for web page.
In body tag, First of all, I"ve created navbar with the help of "nav" tag with "ul" tag (unordered list).

I've used both in flex display and used some margin and padding for adjustment(css) and then I make background:black for better finish,
and also text color: white and give a height of 60px to the nav with the font -family:'Ubuntu' 'sans-serif',

After that I've created a "Div" with container class.
